Let’s create a Cat Loading Animation using HTML and CSS! 🐱⏳
This fun and eye-catching project adds personality to your website’s loading screen with a cute animated cat that loops smoothly.


We’ll use:

HTML to structure the cat and loader elements.
CSS to  animate the cat’s movement, blinking eyes, wagging tail, or bouncing effect.
Whether you’re learning or just having fun, this project is a playful way to understand animation timing, keyframes, and creative CSS design.
